# Applied Physics – Personal Roadmap

This repository outlines my academic and technical roadmap toward applied
physics and industrial R&D.

## Background
I am currently studying physics with a strong interest in understanding
physical systems at a fundamental level.

## Current focus
- Strengthening core physics knowledge (mechanics, mathematics)
- Developing skills in scientific programming (Python, numerical methods)
- Building small simulation projects and a technical portfolio

## Skills under development
- Physical modeling
- Numerical simulation
- Scientific computing
- Data analysis

## Long-term perspective
My objective is to work in industrial R&D, where physics, computation and
problem-solving are combined to address real-world technological challenges.
